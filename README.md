I completed the challenge: 2 - updated project on 10/7, current score 5

I feel good about my code: 2 - current score 5

Worked on the weather API and had city, and country come up when searched. The issue was when Boston would be searched it would give Boston, Ireland. Worked with team Gardner to figure out the issue, and seems like API data in general was not the best. My code was the replica of someone else that used the same API and it still wasn't working. As a group we decided to leave just the zipcode search. I will have to find a new API and redo this project.

## Update on 10/07.
Requested a new key for API. Also edited API url. This fixed the issues with the incorrect location when searching. API is working and search can be used for locations worldwide. Also added CSS.
