# ðŸŒ¦ Project: Weather API

### Goal: Enable your user to enter a city + country and return the temperature in Fahrenheit

### How to submit your code for review:

I completed the challenge: 2

I feel good about my code: 2

Worked on the weather API and had city, and country come up when searched. The issue was when Boston would be searched it would give Boston, Ireland. Worked with team Gardner to figure out the issue, and seems like API data in general was not the best. My code was the replica of someone else that used the same API and it still wasn't working. As a group we decided to leave just the zipcode search. I will have to find a new API and redo this project.
